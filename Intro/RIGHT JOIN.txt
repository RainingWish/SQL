The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), 
and the matched records from the left table (table1). 
The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

RIGHT JOIN Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
