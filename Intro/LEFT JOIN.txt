The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), 
and the matched records from the right table (table2). 
The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

LEFT JOIN Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.conlumn_name;
