The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records.

SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:

SELECT TOP number | percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


MySQL Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;


Oracle Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

"Customers" table

EX1:
//selects the first three records from the "Customers" table
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

EX2:
//shows the equivalent example using the LIMIT clause
SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;

EX3:
//shows the equivalent example using ROWNUM
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;


SQL TOP PERCENT Example
//selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;


ADD a WHERE CLAUSE

EX4: 
//selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany"
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Germany";


EX5:
//EX2 add where
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Germany"
LIMIT 3

EX6:
//EX3 add where
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Germany" AND ROWNUM <= 3;
