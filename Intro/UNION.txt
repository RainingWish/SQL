The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order

UNION Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

UNION ALL Syntax:
//The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL

SELECT Column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

//returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;


SQL UNION ALL Example:
EX2:
//returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;


SQL UNION With WHERE:
EX3:
//returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table

SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Germany"
UNION
SELECT City, County FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country = "Germany"
ORDER BY City;


SQL UNION ALL With WHERE:

//returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table

SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Germany"
UNION ALL
SELECT City, County FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country = "Germany"
