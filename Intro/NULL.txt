A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

Test for NULL Values:

IS NULL Syntax:

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;


IS NOT NULL Syntax:

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The IS NULL Operator:

//lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address is NULL;


The IS NOT NULL Operator

//lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address is NOT NULL;
