A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

"Orders" and "Customers" table

The "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table refers to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table. 
The relationship between the two tables above is the "CustomerID" column.


Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN),
 that selects records that have matching values in both tables:

EX:
SELECT o.OrderID, c.CustomerName, o.OrderDate
FROM Orders AS o
INNER JOIN Customers AS c 
ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;
