The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

EX:
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
"filtered"> FROM table_name;

column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from.
Select Distinct will only output different values (no repeat values).
only ALL column1, column2, ... values are same will be remove

Customers table for example again

1st
We only want to find our customers form which countries,
so use SELECT DISTINCT statement:

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
//Here will listing all countries name

2nd
Use COUNT to find the number of distinct customer countries:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
//Here will return a number

3rd
Here we want to eorkaround for MS Access

SELECT Count(*) As DistinctCountries
"filtered">FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers)'
//here will return a table
	DistinctCountries
		18
