In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table.
The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

CREATE VIEW Syntax

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! 
The database engine recreates the data, 
using the view's SQL statement, every time a user queries a view


CREATE VIEW Examples:

EX1:
//creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil

CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

//We can query the view above as follows:

SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];

EX2:
//creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price

CREATE VIEW [Products Expensive] AS
SELECT ProductName,Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);

//We can query the view above as follows:

SELECT * FROM [Products Expensive];


Updating a View
//A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW command

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_nme AS
SELECT column1, column2,...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

EX3:
//adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";



Dropping a View
//A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW command

Syntax:
DROP VIEW view_name;

EX4:
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];
