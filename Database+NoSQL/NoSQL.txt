NoSQL originally referring to non SQL or non relational is a database.

NoSQL databases are used in real-time web applications and big data and their use are increasing over time.

Advantages of NoSQL:
1. High sclability (use sharding for horizontal scaling)
2.High availability (Auto replication)

Disadvantages of NoSQL:
1.Narrow focus (designed for storage and little functionality)
2.Open-source (no reliable standard)
3.Management challenge (big data -> large amount data as simple as possible)
4.GUI is not available
5.Backup
6.Large document size

When should NoSQL be used:

1.When huge amount of data need to be stored and retrieved .
2.The relationship between the data you store is not that important
3.The data changing over time and is not structured.
4.Support of Constraints and Joins is not required at database level
5.The data is growing continuously and you need to scale the database regular to handle the data.
