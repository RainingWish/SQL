The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table

SELECT INTO Syntax

Copy all columns into a new table:

SELECT *
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;


Copy only some columns into a new table:

SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;


SQL SELECT INTO Examples:

EX1:
//creates a backup copy of Customers

SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2019
FROM Customers;


EX2:
// uses the IN clause to copy the table into a new table in another database

SELECT * INTO Backup2019 IN "Backuo.mdb"
FROM Customers;


EX3:
//copies only a few columns into a new table

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName INTO Backup2019
FROM Customers;


EX4:
//copies only the German customers into a new table

SELECT * INTO CustomerGermany
FROM Customers
WHERE Country  = "Germany";


EX5:
//copies data from more than one table into a new table

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
INTO Backup2019
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

Tip:
SELECT INTO can also be used to create a new,
 empty table using the schema of another. 
Just add a WHERE clause that causes the query to return no data

SELECT * INTO newtable
FROM oldtable
WHERE 1=0;
