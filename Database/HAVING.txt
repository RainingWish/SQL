The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

HAVING Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY coulumn_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT (CustomerID) >5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (Orders
INNRT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
